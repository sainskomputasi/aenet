Since I'm not the owner of aenet, here's what the owner told us to do

Every scientific publication containing results that were produced with ænet should cite the appropriate original references.

The reference for the ænet package itself is: [1] N. Artrith and A. Urban, Comput. Mater. Sci. 114 (2016) 135-150.

If the local structural environment is represented by a Chebyshev descriptor, please cite: [2] N. Artrith, A. Urban, and G. Ceder, Phys. Rev. B 96 (2017) 014112.

The interpolation of atomic energies with ANNs was first published in: [3] J. Behler and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007) 146401.

If the local structural environment is represented by symmetry functions, please cite: [4] J. Behler, J. Chem. Phys. 134 (2011) 074106.

If the SOAP (smooth overlap of atomic positions) descriptor is used for the representation of the local structural environment, please cite: [5] A. P. Bartók, M. C. Payne, R. Kondor, and G. Csányi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 (2010) 136403.

The L-BFGS-B method is provided by a third party library. Whenever the method is used for training, please cite: [6] R. H. Byrd, P. Lu and J. Nocedal, SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comp. 16 (1995) 1190-1208.

The references for the Levenberg-Marquardt method are: [7] K. Levenberg, Q. Appl. Math. 2 (1944) 164–168; [8] D. W. Marquardt, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 11 (1963) 431–441.
